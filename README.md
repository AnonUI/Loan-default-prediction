# Loan-default-prediction
Logistic regression model with SHAP explainability for predicting loan defaults
# Loan Default Prediction Model

This project uses logistic regression to predict loan default risk based on customer and loan features. It includes model training, SHAP-based explainability, and a clean output for dashboard integration.

## Files
- `loan_default_predictions.csv`: Final predictions with probabilities
- `model_pipeline.py`: Full modeling and preprocessing code
- `shap_feature_importance.csv`: Ranked SHAP values for feature importance

## Highlights
- Trained on 3,000+ loans
- 35 features including behavioral, financial, and demographic data
- SHAP explainability integrated
